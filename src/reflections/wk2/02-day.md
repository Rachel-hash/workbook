## What are the three ways to syntactically write a function? What are the differences in how the function acts, if any?
The three ways are function declaration, function expressions, and arrow function expression. Function declarations are hoisted while function expressions are not. Arrow functions do not have a 'this' value. 
## What is the difference between parameters and arguments?
Parameters are the names inside a function. Arguments are the values the function receives from the parameters. 
## What are higher order functions? Can you provide an example?
Higher order functions are functions that accept other functions as parameters or returns a function. An example would be array.prototype.map.
