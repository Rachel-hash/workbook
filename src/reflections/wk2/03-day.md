## What are the main ways to write information to the console? Why/when should you use each style?
You can use console.log() or you can go directly to the console and write in the console tab. You should use console.log() in your code if you want to make sure everything is linked properly. And if you go directly to the console you are able to write something and you can see immediately the change it made. 
## Which tab allows you to see the breakdown of HTML/CSS and how can this tab be useful when debugging HTML?
The elements tab allows you to see the breakdown of HTML and CSS. This tab can be useful because you can manipulate your code in the tab and see immediate results in your project, allowing you to discover the problem and then fix it in your code. 
## Outside of writing everything to the console, what is a better way to debug your code?
You can add break points to your code. This will pause your code and allow to see where your problem is.
