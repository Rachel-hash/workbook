## What is Scope?
Scope is everything that is inside a set of {}. This includes strings, arrays, functions, etc. 
## What is hoisting?
Hoisting is a mechanism in JS that brings variables to the top of their scope. This makes it easier to read and find variables. 
## In what cases might you use var vs let vs const?
You would use var when you want frequently change the variable, no matter where it is located in your code. You would use let if you want to have more control over when it is changed. And you would use const if you only want to declare the variable once and have it never change.
