## What are the benefits of making a plan before starting to just write the code?
If you make a plan you have a better understanding of everything you need; you can get a grasp of the structure of your code. This can make the process seem less daunting.
## How do you find answers when you are stuck?
You can google answers; stack overflow and developer modzilla are great sites to find answers. And you can always ask a friend or coworker to help you solve the problem. 
## From the entire article what are your biggest takeaways?
My biggest takeaways from the article are that 1, it is ok to feel overwhelmed, code is a huge field but I'll always have help from others. And 2, to never become too attached to a plan for my code. I could be working with a team and they have a different vision for the project and that is ok. Or the client has a last minute change, that is ok.
