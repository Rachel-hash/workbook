## What is a Pseudo-Class and what are some of the most common ones you think you will use?
A pseudo-class is a keyword that is applied to a selector. It tells the html that only if both the css class and the pseudo-class are present then those attributes will be applied. 

## What is Specificity and how might you use it to your benefit?
Specificity is the rule browsers use to choose which values are most important to an element which then decides which ones to use/display. I can use this to my benefit by giving the more appealing elements a greater specificity which would make me page/ app look more beautiful to the client. 

## What problems do you think you could run into if you over-utilize the !important feature?
If I were to overuse !important I could make things override each other without realizing it.
