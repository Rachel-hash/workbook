## What is the purpose of wire-framing?
Wire-framing is a form of communication with the users, the stakeholders and the designers. 
## What are the different levels of detail in wire-frames and why is each one useful?
The first level of detail is the low-fidelity wire-frame. This one is useful for meetings with clients/stakeholders who want a simplified explanation/visualization for their product. The second level of detail is the mid-fidelity wire-frame. This one has more body to it. There are different levels in the design more specifics of the skeleton of the page. It is useful because it gives even more detail and the designers have a better idea of how the finished product is supposed to look. The third level in the design is the high-fidelity wire-frame. This level is useful because instead of filler text or icons indicating a picture, there are actual pictures, actual words that matter, in the product.
## Do you think wire-frames are worth the time, energy, and effort that they require? Why or why not?
I think wire-frames are worth it all. They give every person on the design team the same resource to work from. It gives the clients/stockholders something simple to look at and easy to understand so they can be informed and stay on top of the progress. And they'll know how it looks for every stage of development so they can be more at ease.
