## How do you think good design influences people when visiting a website and what sorts of things could you convey through design alone?
Good design influences people by creating a professional atmosphere within the space they're in. You can convey professionalism, that you and your design team care about the little details, and that no matter what you are selling you're promising to put as much care into that as in your web design.
